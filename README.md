# OOP - TV Status
An Object-Oriented Programming project that diaplays the channel and volume of certain TVs.
## How it Works
You can see that there are 2 files in this repository. The file **ClassTV.py** has the class that the other file **TestTV** will import from and use its functions.
### How to Use
**DO NOT**, I repeat, **DO NOT** edit the ***ClassTV*** file for it contains the functions that the ***TestTV*** file will use. That being said, the only editable parts are within the ***TestTV*** file <sub>(obviously)</sub>. They are in the `TV()` function and the different quoted numbers and words mean something which are in the ***ClassTV*** file, inside the `def__init__()`. Once you start the **TestTV** program, 2 prompts will show up to ask you what TV number do you want to create and to be checked. Once you have set your own values in said editable part and prompts, the program will use the functions inside ***ClassTV.py*** and print out the output.
