# OOP - TV Status
An Object-Oriented Programming project that diaplays the channel and volume of certain TVs.
## How it Works
You can see that there are 2 files in this repository. The file **ClassTV.py** has the class that the other file **TestTV** will import from and use its functions.
### How to Use
**DO NOT**, I repeat, **DO NOT** edit the ***ClassTV*** file for it contains the functions that the ***TestTV*** file will use. That being said, the only editable parts are within the ***TestTV*** file <sub>(obviously)</sub>. They are in the `TV()` function and the different quoted numbers and words mean something which are in the ***ClassTV*** file, inside the `def__init__()`. Once you have set your own values in said editable part, the program will use the functions inside ***ClassTV.py*** and print out the output.
